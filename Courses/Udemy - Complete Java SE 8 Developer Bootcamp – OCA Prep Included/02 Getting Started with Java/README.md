## Parameter vs Argument
   Generally a **parameter** is what appears in the definition of the method. An **argument** is the instance passed to the method during runtime.
   ```java
   int square(int n){
        return n * n;
   }
   int printSquare(){
        System.out.println(square(3));
   }
```
   Here, n in ```square(int n)``` is called **parameter** or formal parameter and 3 in ```square(3)``` is called **argument** or actual parameter.
