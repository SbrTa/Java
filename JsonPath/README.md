# JsonPath

A Java DSL for reading JSON documents.

Sometimes we need to query into a json of huge size, ie- the original json file from where the given sample json file derived was of 6071 line. Quering in such large json is realy challenging. Is such case ***Jayway JsonPath*** comes real handy.

JsonPath is available at the Central Maven Repository.

```
